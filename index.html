            <p><strong>Caitlin Clark, who is expected to be the No. 1 pick in Monday's WNBA draft, deftly skewered “Weekend Update” co-host Michael Che in a “Saturday Night Live” appearance and used the platform to offer a reminder of the many women's basketball stars who came before her. Clark came back on stage at the end of the show, bringing her former Hawkeye teammates Kate Martin, Gabbie Marshall and Jada Gyamfi with her. “It's so cool, they got into New York City yesterday,” 
                Clark said of her teammates. Just in case you're wondering, it's made by Nike and it's called the Women's Oversized Wool Destroyer Jacket. </strong></p>
